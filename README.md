For my first project, i wanted to learn and develop my skills in developing predictive models in a field I am passionate in, this being Swimming, more specifically thr 100m Freeestyle. The main reason beehind choosing this as controversily, the 2024 Paris Olympic pool was only 2.1m in depth compared to the usual 3m of depth, which some believe, myself included, may have resulted in slower times than what was expected, especially since the world championships from the previous year had faster results in almost all events. So the goal of this project was to develop my skills in building predictive models, as well as, investigate to what extent a shallower pool affected the result in the Mens 100m Freestyle at the Paris Olympics.

For my initial model, I trained it using a linear regression model, as historically, times in the 100m freestyle and in the sport of swimming have continued to decrease. To start with, a kaggle dataset that included every result in swimming at the olympics since its inception was cleaned so that only results from the Mens 100m Freestyle from 1972 onwards were included for model training. Utilising the Seaborn package, I first plot Year and Result against each other to first confirm whether the linear regression model would be suitable for the dataset.
